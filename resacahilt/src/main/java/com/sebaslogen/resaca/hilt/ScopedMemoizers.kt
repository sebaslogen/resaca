 *
 * Internally, a key will be generated for this [ScopedViewModelOwner] in the Compose tree and if a [ScopedViewModelOwner] is present
 * for this key in the [ScopedViewModelContainer], then it will be used to invoke [ViewModelProvider] to return an existing [ViewModel],
 * instead of creating a new [ScopedViewModelOwner] that produces a new [ViewModel] instance when the keys don't match.
 *
 * @param key Key to track the version of the [ViewModel]. Changing [key] between compositions will produce and store a new [ViewModel].
 * @param keyInScopeResolver A function that uses [key] to determine if the ViewModel should be kept in memory even after it's no longer part of the composition.
 * @param defaultArguments A [Bundle] containing all the default arguments that will be provided to the [ViewModel].
