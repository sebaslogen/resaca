# Resaca Demo App üçπ

The purpose of this app is to show the usage of the `rememberScoped` function in the context of different lifecycle events.

The demo will instantiate different fake business logic
objects ([FakeRepo](https://github.com/sebaslogen/resaca/blob/main/sample/src/main/java/com/sebaslogen/resacaapp/sample/ui/main/data/FakeRepo.kt)
, [FakeScopedViewModel](https://github.com/sebaslogen/resaca/blob/main/sample/src/main/java/com/sebaslogen/resacaapp/sample/ui/main/data/FakeScopedViewModel.kt)
or [FakeInjectedViewModel](https://github.com/sebaslogen/resaca/blob/main/sample/src/main/java/com/sebaslogen/resacaapp/sample/ui/main/data/FakeInjectedViewModel.kt))
and either scope them with `rememberScoped`, `hiltViewModelScoped` or with the vanilla `remember` from Compose, to illustrate the differences in memory
retention across different lifecycle events.

The remembered objects will be represented on the screen with their **unique memory location** by rendering:

- the object's toString representation in a `Text` Composable
- a unique color for the object's instance using `objectToColorInt` as background
- a semi-unique emoji for the object's instance (limited to list of emojis available
  in [emojis](https://github.com/sebaslogen/resaca/blob/main/sample/src/main/java/com/sebaslogen/resacaapp/sample/ui/main/ui/theme/Emojis.kt))

# Screens structure of the app

The app contains the following screens:

- **Main Activity**. Purpose: show Fragment navigation/lifecycle events and Activity configuration changes (Activity _recreation_)
    + Composable content. Purpose: show Activity configuration changes and entry point for ComposeActivity
        * 2 Scoped objects
        * Button to Navigate to ComposeActivity
    + **MainFragment**. Purpose: show Fragment navigation/lifecycle events when MainFragment goes into the backstack, and then comes back and its View is
      _recreated_
        * 1 Not scoped object
        * 2 Scoped objects
        * Button to Navigate to **FragmentTwo**
    + **FragmentTwo**. Purpose: push **MainFragment** into the backstack to destroy its View
- **ComposeActivity**. Purpose: show Compose navigation/lifecycle events with Compose Navigation destinations
    + **first rememberScoped** Compose destination. Purpose: show Compose navigation/lifecycle events when destination goes into the backstack, comes back and
      its Composables are _recreated_
        * 1 Not scoped object
        * 2 Scoped objects
        * Button to Navigate to first
        * Button to Navigate to second
        * Button to Navigate back
    + **second Hilt hiltViewModelScoped** Compose destination. Purpose: show Activity configuration changes (Activity _recreation_) and Compose conditional UI (
      in dark mode for this example) when using Hilt injected ViewModels
        * 1 Not scoped object
        * 1 Scoped object (FakeRepo with `rememberScoped`)
        * 1 Hilt Injected Scoped ViewModel (FakeInjectedViewModel with `hiltViewModelScoped`)

# Lifecycle events

Here is a list of lifecycle events where `rememberScoped` will retain objects:

- Android Configuration change. Examples: App size changes (like in split screen), light/dark mode switches, rotation, language, etc.
- Fragment goes into the backstack
- Composable destination goes into the backstack
